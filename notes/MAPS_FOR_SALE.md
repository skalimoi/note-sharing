# MAPS FOR SALE

Hey there! As I said yesterday on #maps, I have a bunch of spare continents and worlds that I'm not going to use, so they're for sale.  I've spent a lot of time on each one and they were originally for my own use so they're of the highest quality.

All continents consist of a grayscale elevation map - the colors shown in the images are for visualization purposes.

Please contact me on Discord if you're interested in any of them - they might be purchased already if you take too long.

Payment is only done via Paypal.

## What you get

Complete ownership over the map! You can modify it as you please and there is no need to credit me - it would be nice though.

The base image of the map - a 16-bit grayscale PNG with elevation data (what is commonly called a heightmap).

A river map with complete accuracy and realism.

## Continent 1
Map size: 32768px x 32768px

Includes a water (rivers) map.

## Continent 2
Map size: 32768px x 32768px

This is my most recent work, finished only last week. Realized yesterday that I don't need it anymore. The northern ranges are covered by a giant glacier, hence the apparent lack of detail.
