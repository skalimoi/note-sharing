# MAPS FOR SALE

All continents consist of a grayscale elevation map - the colors shown in the images are for visualization purposes.

Please contact me on Discord if you're interested in any of them - they might be purchased already if you take too long.

Payment is only done via Paypal.

## What you get

Complete ownership over the map! You can modify it as you please and there is no need to credit me - it would be nice though.

The base image of the map - a 16-bit grayscale PNG with elevation data (what is commonly called a heightmap).

A river map with complete accuracy and realism.
