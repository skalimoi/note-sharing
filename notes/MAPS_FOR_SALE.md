Hey there! As I said yesterday on #maps, I have a bunch of spare continents and worlds that I'm not going to use, so they're for sale.  I've spent a lot of time on each one and they were originally for my own use so they're of the highest quality.

All continents consist of a grayscale elevation map - the colors shown in the images are for visualization purposes.
